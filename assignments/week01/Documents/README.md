# Course Project Description

For my final project I will create a travel website. I haven't decided if I plan on doing a travel guide, travel blog or the specifics of what will be on site.
I decided to pick this topic because I love to travel and I enjoy looking at other people's travel experiences and photos. Furthermore, I enjoy planning out my trips and figuring out what places I'm going to visit.


API: I did some research on this and there are not any free travel guide APIs. These APIs would provide information on flights, cars, hotels, trains, fare rates.

Location: Google Maps

Images: I have a decent amount of photos from a few countries in Europe and Asia so I could use these for images I find on Creative Commons
